# Introduction

`Nmap is an open source program released under the GNU General Public License (see www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). It is an evaluable tool for network administrators which can be used to discover, monitor, and troubleshoot TCP/IP systems. Nmap is a free cross-platform network scanning utility created by Gordon
‚ÄúFyodor‚Äù Lyon and is actively developed by a community of volunteers.`

A typical Nmap scan Nmap‚Äôs award-winning suite of network scanning utilities has been in constant development since 1997 and continually improves with each new release. Version 5.00 of Nmap (released in July of 2009) adds many new features and enhancements
including:
ÔÇ∑ Improved service and operating system version detection.
ÔÇ∑ Improved support for Windows and Mac OS X.
ÔÇ∑ Improved Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) for performing complex scanning
tasks.
ÔÇ∑ Addition of the Ndiff utility which can be used to compare Nmap scans.
ÔÇ∑ Ability to graphically display network topology with Zenmap.
ÔÇ∑ Additional language localizations including German, French, and
Portuguese.
ÔÇ∑ Better overall performance.

The Nmap project relies on volunteers to support and develop this amazing tool. If you would like to help improve Nmap, there are several ways to get involved:
Promote Nmap.

Nmap is a wonderful tool that every administrator network should know about. Despite its popularity, Nmap isn‚Äôt widely known outside of technically elite circles. Promote Nmap by introducing it to your friends or write a blog entry about it and help spread the word.

# Report Bugs
You can help improve Nmap by reporting any bugs you discover to the Nmap developers. The Nmap project provides a mailing list for this which can be found online at www.seclists.org/nmap-dev.

# Note
Thousands of people worldwide use Nmap. Additionally, Nmap developers are very busy people. Before reporting a bug, or asking for assistance, you should search the Nmap website at www.insecure.org/search.html to make sure your problem hasn‚Äôt already been reported or resolved.

# Contribute Code
If you‚Äôre a hacker with some spare time on your hands, you can get involved with Nmap development. To learn more about contributing code to the Nmap project visit www.nmap.org/data/HACKING.

The Nmap project does not accept donations. If, however, you have a security related service you would like promote, you can sponsor Nmap by purchasing an
advertising package on the insecure.org website. For more information visit www.insecure.org/advertising.html.

  # Installing Nmap 
  
## Step 1
Download the Windows version of Nmap from www.nmap.org.
## Step 2
Launch the Nmap setup program. Select the default installation (recommended) which will install the entire Nmap suite of utilities. During installation, a helper program called WinPcap will also be installed. WinPcap is required for Nmap to function properly on the Windows platform so do not skip this step.                       

## Step 3
Once Nmap has been successfully installed you can verify it is working correctly by
executing nmap scanme.insecure.org on the command line (located in Start >Programs > Accessories > Command Prompt).

## Installing Nmap on Unix and Linux systems: 
Most popular Linux distributions provide binary Nmap packages which allow for simple installation. Installation on Unix systems requires compiling Nmap from source code.

### Installing Precompiled Packages for Linux For Debian and Ubuntu based systems
 `apt-get install nmap`
### For Red Hat and Fedora based systems
` yum install nmap`
### For Gentoo Linux based systems
 `emerge nmap`
### To check which version of Nmap you are running, type the following command on
the command line:
 `nmap -V`
`Nmap version 8.00 ( http://nmap.org )`

## Once Nmap has been successfully installed, you can verify it is working correctly by executing nmap localhost on the command line.
`$ nmap localhost`

## Basic Scanning Techniques

## Basic Scanning Overview
This section covers the basics of network scanning with Nmap. Before we begin it is
important to understand the following concepts:

### Firewalls, routers, proxy servers, and other security devices can skew the results of an Nmap scan. Scanning remote hosts that are not on your local network may provide misleading information because of this.

### Some scanning options require elevated privileges. On Unix and Linuxsystems you may be required to login as the root user or to execute Nmap using the sudo command.

### There are also several warnings to take into consideration:
Scanning networks that you do not have permission to scan can get you in trouble with your internet service provider, the police, and possibly even the
government. Don‚Äôt go off scanning the FBI or Secret Service websites unless you want to get in trouble.

Aggressively scanning some systems may cause them to crash which can lead to undesirable results like system downtime and data loss. Always scan mission critical systems with caution.

## Nmap Port States

### open
An open port is a port that actively responds to an incoming connection.
### closed
A closed port is a port on a target that actively responds to a probe but does not
have any service running on the port. Closed ports are commonly found on systems
where no firewall is in place to filter incoming traffic.
### filtered
Filtered ports are ports that are typically protected by a firewall of some sort that
prevents Nmap from determining whether or not the port is open or closed.
### unfiltered
An unfiltered port is a port that Nmap can access but is unable to determine
whether it is open or closed.
#### open|filtered
An open|filtered port is a port which Nmap believes to be open or filtered but
cannot determine which exact state the port is actually in.
### closed|filtered
A closed|filtered port is a port that Nmap believes to be closed or filtered but
cannot determine which respective state the port is actually in
